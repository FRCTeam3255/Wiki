# Topic 2.2: Feature Importance List

Defining and prioritizing robot features that will drive the design.

## Overview

The Feature Importance List is a prioritized list of robot capabilities that drive design decisions. Features are abilities that our robot should have to be competitive, derived from the [Scoring Analysis](Topic%202.1%20-%20Scoring%20Analysis.md).

**Examples of features:**
- Score high
- Score mid
- Score low
- Perform all actions autonomously
- Climb
- Defend
- Speed

## Feature Creation Schedule

### During Mock Kickoff

**Scheduled Time**: 3:00 pm - 4:30 pm (1.5 hours)

Initial feature list creation using the practice game, followed by additional refinement:
- 4:45 pm - 5:30 pm (45 min): Feature importance list rankings practice

### During Actual Kickoff

**Scheduled Time**: 5:45 pm - 7:45 pm (2 hours)

Creating the actual feature importance list for the real game.

## Ranking System

Features are ranked on a scale to prioritize development effort:

- **Rank 5**: Minimum Viable Robot (Regional 1)
  - Essential features needed to compete
  - Must be completed before first regional
  
- **Rank 4**: Competitive Robot (Regional 1)
  - Features that make the robot competitive
  - Target for first regional
  
- **Rank 3**: Optimizations (Target Regional 1)
  - Nice-to-have improvements
  - Stretch goals for first regional
  
- **Rank 2**: Try to do it but not too hard (Optional)
  - Additional features if time permits
  - Low priority
  
- **Rank 1**: If it's free, do it (Optional)
  - Only implement if extremely easy
  - No significant effort invested
  
- **Rank 0**: Not doing - won't even test
  - Explicitly excluded features
  - Not worth the effort

## Ranking Guidelines

When ranking features, assume:

- **Solo robot**: Evaluate as if our robot is alone (no alliance partners)
- **No difficulty consideration**: Ignore implementation complexity during initial ranking
- **Features in isolation**: Each feature stands alone (usually)
- **Focus on capability**: What the robot CAN do, not how hard it is to implement

## Creation Process

1. **Identify all possible features**
   - Review scoring analysis results
   - Consider all game actions
   - Think about autonomous capabilities
   - Don't forget defense and support roles

2. **Define each feature clearly**
   - Be specific about what the feature enables
   - Use action-oriented descriptions
   - Ensure features are measurable/testable

3. **Initial ranking**
   - Rank based on impact to match performance
   - Don't worry about implementation difficulty yet
   - Focus on "what helps us win?"

4. **Review and refine**
   - Compare features at same rank level
   - Ensure ranking order makes sense
   - Adjust based on team discussion

5. **Document rationale**
   - Note why high-priority features are critical
   - Explain why low-priority features are deprioritized
   - Keep scoring analysis data attached

## Using the Feature Importance List

The feature list is used throughout build season:

- Guides [Robot Architecture](Topic%203%20-%20Robot%20Architecture.md) decisions
- Helps prioritize prototyping efforts
- Informs design trade-offs
- Validates architecture proposals
- Tracks progress toward goals

During architecture evaluation, count how many features of each rank a proposed design satisfies, considering complexity as a secondary factor.

## Tips for Effective Feature Lists

- Be specific: "Score in high goal" not just "score"
- Think end-to-end: Consider intake, transport, and scoring together
- Remember autonomous: Auto capabilities are often crucial
- Consider cycle time: Speed of actions matters
- Don't over-complicate: Keep the list manageable (typically 10-20 features)
- Update as needed: The list can evolve as you learn more about the game
