1. Regroup as whole team
2. 2 presenters for each group come up
3. Mentors ask 1 manual analysis question at a time
   1. Presenters state their answers to questions regardless of group
   2. Create master list of answers to analysis questions
   3. repeat for next question
4. Review master list of analysis questions and fill gaps
5. Each individual group presents extra notes/questions
   1. Create master list of extra notes
   2. Create master list of questions to ask FIRST Q&A
