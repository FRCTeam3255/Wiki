## Overview

Scoring method analysis is a critical phase during both Mock Kickoff and actual Kickoff where the team analyzes the game's scoring mechanics to identify optimal strategies.

## Key Questions to Answer

- **Ranking Points vs Match Points**: How do ranking points affect strategy?
- Point calculations and combinations
- Scoring density analysis
- Auto vs Teleop scoring comparison
- Do Ranking Points (RP) become match points?

## Analysis Process

### During Mock Kickoff

**Scheduled Time**: 2:00 pm - 3:00 pm (1 hour)

- Focus on understanding the practice game's scoring mechanics
- Calculate point combinations and maximums
- Analyze scoring density by location
- Compare autonomous vs teleoperated scoring
- Practice the analysis methodology

### During Actual Kickoff

**Scheduled Time**: 3:15 pm - 5:15 pm (2 hours)

- Apply the learned methodology to the actual game
- Consider our robot as the only robot on the field
- Have one person read the manual while another writes
- Include processing time in duration calculations
- Calculate maximum possible scores
- Identify most efficient scoring methods

## Analysis Framework

When conducting scoring analysis:

1. **Identify all scoring opportunities**
   - List every way to score points
   - Note point values for each action
   - Identify timing constraints (auto vs teleop)

2. **Calculate theoretical maximums**
   - Maximum points in autonomous
   - Maximum points in teleoperated period
   - Total maximum match score
   - Include processing/cycle time

3. **Determine scoring density**
   - Points per second for each scoring method
   - Consider distance to scoring locations
   - Factor in game piece availability

4. **Analyze ranking point opportunities**
   - Conditions for earning ranking points
   - Impact on match strategy
   - Priority relative to match points

5. **Consider realistic scenarios**
   - What can a single robot accomplish?
   - What scores are achievable with partners?
   - Defensive considerations

## Outputs

The scoring analysis should produce:

- Documented point values for all scoring methods
- Calculated maximum scores (theoretical and realistic)
- Prioritized list of scoring actions by efficiency
- Ranking point strategy recommendations
- Data to inform the [Feature Importance List](Topic%202.2%20-%20Feature%20Importance%20List.md)

## Tips

- Use spreadsheets to track calculations
- Consider time as a resource
- Think about cycle times early
- Don't forget about autonomous bonuses
- Compare multiple strategies mathematically
- Document all assumptions made
