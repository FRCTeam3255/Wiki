# Feature Importance List
The Feature Importance List is a prioritized list of robot capabilities that drive design decisions. 

[2025 Retrobot Example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L6yl4PBxVenyQtbBaMPIxDMIrqewOWmwFbR4vLWvi_g/edit?gid=173125914#gid=173125914)

## Creating the List
1. Reference Scoring Method Analysis sheet
2. Open Feature Importance List sheet. For each feature record: (In Section)
    - Scoring Element Quantity
    - Points Per Element 
    - Theorhetical Max Points
    - Tele-Op Rp Ratio
    - Auto RP Ratio
3. List all fouls (Negative Points)
4. List all Autonomous scoring methods
5. List Tele-Op scoring methods
6. List Endgame scoring methods
7. List each location you can pickup scoring elements (ex. floor, human feeder)
8. List ability combos/unlocks (ex. start with scoring element, store certain quantitiy of scoring element)
9. List potential Autonomous routines
10. Answer design consideration questions



## Feature Importance List Ranking

- Features are ranked on a scale to analyze competitive preformance benefit. (Looking at match points and ranking points)
- Having more high ranked features makes a more competitive robot. (You want all the 5s, and as many 4s, 3s, 2s, and 1s as possible, with each number decreasing how much competitive benefit it gives you)


 ## Ranking Legend
- **5 Ranking**: 
  - Most essential features needed to preform at a comp
  - Must be completed to attend a regional
  - 
  
- **4 Ranking**: Competitive Robot
  - Features needed to make robot very competitive
  - Target for first regional
  
- **3 Ranking**: Optimizations
  - Features that will benefit the robot on top of being competitive
  - Stretch goals for first regional
  
- **2 Ranking**: Try to do it but not too hard (Optional)
  - Additional features to mae robot better if time permits
  - Low priority
  
- **1 Ranking**: If it's free, do it (Optional)
  - Features that make the rogot a bit better
  - Only implement if extremely easy
  - No significant effort invested
  
- **0 Ranking**: Not doing - won't even test
  - Explicitly excluded features
  - Not worth the effort
