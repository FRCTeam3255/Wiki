# Robot Name Voting

Each season the team votes on a name for the competition robot. The name helps build team identity and excitement around the build season.

## Naming Criteria

A good robot name should meet one or more of the following:

- Matches the **robot's design or capabilities** (e.g. a robot that shoots coral could have a name related to the sea)
- Matches the **game theme** set by FIRST for the season
- Ideally matches **both** the robot design and the game theme

## Gathering Initial Names

- Any team member may submit a name idea
- Names are collected informally (e.g. via Slack, in person, or at the start of a meeting)
- All submitted names are written on the **whiteboard** so the whole team can see them

## Voting Process

### Round 1 — Initial Vote

- Each team member gets **2 votes**
- The **top 3** names with the most votes move on to Round 2

### Round 2 — Final Vote

- Each team member gets **1 vote**
- The name with the **most votes wins** and becomes the official robot name for the season

## Voting System

- Votes are cast using **tally marks on the whiteboard** in the build space so all votes are visible to everyone in real time
- In the event of a **tie** in Round 1, all tied names advance to Round 2
- In the event of a **tie** in Round 2, the team holds a run-off vote with 1 vote per person between only the tied names
