# Day 1.3: Feature Importance List
The Feature Importance List is a prioritized list of robot capabilities that drive design decisions. 

[2025 Retrobot Example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L6yl4PBxVenyQtbBaMPIxDMIrqewOWmwFbR4vLWvi_g/edit?gid=173125914#gid=173125914)

## Creating the List
1. Reference Scoring Method Analysis sheet
2. Open Feature Importance List sheet. For each feature record: (In Section)
    - Scoring Element Quantity
    - Points Per Element 
    - Theorhetical Max Points
    - Tele-Op Rp Ratio
    - Auto RP Ratio
3. List all fouls (Negative Points)
4. List all Autonomous scoring methods
5. List Tele-Op scoring methods
6. List Endgame scoring methods
7. List each location you can pickup scoring elements (ex. floor, human feeder)
8. List ability combos/unlocks (ex. start with scoring element, store certain quantitiy of scoring element)
9. List potential Autonomous routines
10. Answer design consideration questions


## Feature Importance List Ranking

- Features are ranked on a scale to analyze competitive preformance benefit. (Looking at match points and ranking points)
- Having more high ranked features makes a more competitive robot. (You want all the 5s, and as many 4s, 3s, 2s, and 1s as possible, with each number decreasing how much competitive benefit it gives you). Ex. When doing design, we would sacrfice a 4 to obtain a 5 feature.


 ## Ranking Legend
- **5 Ranking**: 
  - The most beneficial robot features (ex. High Match Points, High Ranking Point Ratio)
  - We wouldn't want to go to a comp without all 5s satisfied

  
- **4 Ranking**:
  - Very beneficial features 
  - Features needed to make robot very competitive
  - Target for first regional
  
- **3 Ranking**: 
  - Features that will benefit the robot on top of being competitive, Optimizations
  - Stretch goals for first regional
  
- **2 Ranking**:
  - Additional features to make robot better if time permits
  - Try to do it but not too hard
  - Low priority
  
- **1 Ranking**: 
  - If it's free, do it (Optional)
  - Features that make the robot somewhat better
  - Only implement if extremely easy
  - No significant effort invested
  
- **0 Ranking**: Not doing - won't even test
  - Explicitly excluded features
  - Not worth the effort
