# Assembly Standard

## Riveting

### Standard Pattern

Rivets are normally placed in every other hole (e.g. rivet, skip, rivet) starting from the farthest edges and working inward.

### Steps

1. Place [Clecos](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-k9b7cqysdc/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/2324/18000/ALL18225__51404.1654003570.jpg?c=2?imbypass=on) (Place in a way were they do not need to be removed to place rivets)
2. Get mentor/student lead inspection
3. Place rivets (do not rivet them) in all holes following the [standard pattern](#standard-pattern). If a rivet does not fit in the hole (i.e. the hole is too small), move on with the pattern as if it was placed successfully.
4. Get mentor/student lead inspection
5. Secure (rivet) the rivets
6. Widen out the holes that rivets would not fit in (run 3/16th drill through)
7. Place remaining rivets in those holes
8. Get mentor/student lead inspection
9. Secure (rivet) the rivets
10. Remove Clecos
