# Selecting a Battery

1. Find a battery that is connected to a solid green charging LED.
    - **Solid Green:** Fully charged
    - **Blinking:** In the process of charging

Use our battery beaks to measure our battery values. Plug the beak into the battery lead and press the button. Ideally, we are looking for the following values:
    - **Battery Charge:** 110% or more
    - **Internal Resistance (Rint):** 0.016 or less

3. Fill out our [battery health survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSed6jYaXZtyBU3A1h9Mz7zwHt_hu3aquWZuPRPW4qUz_wQl4A/viewform) to keep track of our battery stats.

4. Once done with the battery, _please_ remember to take it out of the robot and plug it back into the battery charger!
