# Crimping Instructions

These terminals have a seam in the center as part of their manufacturing process. This makes it important to ensure proper orientation when crimping.

1. Place the terminal so the seam is resting in the semicircular side of the crimp jaw.
2. Use the correct jaw:
    - "1.25" for 22 AWG (furthest from handle)
    - "5.5" for 10 AWG (closest to handle)
3. Squeeze the handle until it releases.
4. The tool will imprint a number ("1" for 22 AWG, "5" for 10 AWG) on the seam side.
