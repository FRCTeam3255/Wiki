# War Room

## How does alliance selection work?

- If you are top 8 rank teams (or moved up via seed compression) you can accept or decline

## Why/how we do war room

1. We need to choose the best partners for our team!
2. This is a group discussion and everyone should have input
3. WE ARE **DATA AND OBJECTIVE BASED**. Subjectivity is bad!

## Setup

1. Disable team numbers - we don't want to influence/skew our decisions
1. Un-group categories so we can select specific items we want

## Discussion

1. What we do best
1. What we do not so well
      1. What would strengthen our alliance if we had it?
1. What do we want to check for?
      1. These are the things we want to make **sure** they do.
      2. If they do other stuff, neat, but we don't care if they do or don't

## How to read the app

- We choose what categories we want to make sure our alliance has, the app will rank each team by sum of average matches.
- The app tells us who to choose
- Only thing that matters in playoffs is points
- "Do we want out partner's ability to do this be part of their ranking?"
