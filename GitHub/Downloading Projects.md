## Committing and Pushing to a Repo

2. When you're happy with your set of changes, you can **commit** them. A **commit** in Git is essentially creating a snapshot of your changes. To do this, you write a commit message and click the `Commit` button *Note: Committing changes does not upload them. They only live locally on your computer until you **push** them*

3. Once you've made your commits and are ready to upload your changes, you can click the `Push origin` button. From there, you and others will be able to see your changes in the GitHub website in browser. Congrats! You've just pushed your changes!
