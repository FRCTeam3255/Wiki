- Who is interacting with teams that reach out to?
- Elaborate on the Lectec collaboration. A judge recognized them from a Sharktank episode and found it cool we were working with them. How did we get involved with them?
- How are we mentoring teams long distance vs. teams locally?
- What are we most proud of about our team?
