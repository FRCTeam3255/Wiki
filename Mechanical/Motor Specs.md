# Motor Specifications

This page displays motor specifications of common motors used in FRC robotics.

!!! note

    These values represent the free speed (no load) RPM for each motor.

## Motor Specifications

| Kraken x60    | Brushless  | 6,000 RPM            | 7.09 N·m     | 366 A         | 2 A          | 1.2 lbs  |
| Kraken x44    | Brushless  | 7,530 RPM            | 4.05 N·m     | 275 A         | 2 A          | 0.75 lbs |
| Falcon 500    | Brushless  | 6,380 RPM            | 4.69 N·m     | 257 A         | 1.5 A        | 1.1 lbs  |
| CIM           | Brushed    | 5,310 RPM            | 2.425 N·m    | 131 A         | 2.7 A        | 2.8 lbs  |
| Mini CIM      | Brushed    | 5,840 RPM            | 1.41 N·m     | 89 A          | 3 A          | 2.16 lbs |
| Bag Motor     | Brushed    | 13,180 RPM           | 0.43 N·m     | 53 A          | 1.8 A        | 0.71 lbs |

!!! note

    Brushed motors are "dumb" motors and need motor controllers (TalonSRX) wired between them and the robot.

!!! tip

    When selecting a motor, consider not just the RPM but also the torque requirements, weight constraints, and available space on your robot.
