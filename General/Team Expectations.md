# Team Expectations

- Please come to all meetings that you can, we are a team working together for a common goal
  - **If you cannot attend a meeting (or will be late) please fill out the [absent form](https://supernurds.com/absent)**
  - The more you put in the more you get out
  - If you have to miss a meeting make sure you have documented what works needs to get done when you arent present
- Make sure all work assigned to you is complete
  - We unfortunately can't afford to bring everyone to comp, so role responsbility/attendance plays a big part
  - Don't volunteer to own something if you aren't sure you can complete it
  - Anyone can step up and become a leader!
