The front of the robot is typically the side that the scoring mechanism is on, but it can be any side. Having it be the scoring mechanism side makes it easy to remember. Whichever side you choose, you need to keep it consistent across both robots (comp & practice), the AdvantageScope models, and PathPlanner. You'll need to communicate which side is the front to the rest of the team. Steps Pick a side to be the front! Take Gaff tape and physically label the front of the robot so that it's visible from the underside Also label the robot's left & right. This saves lots of headaches later. If you're looking at the underside, this may not match your left and right, since they're relative to where the robot's left is when it's on the ground. This depends on how the robot is tipped over. Reference the WPILib Robot coordinate system ; The robot's left is positive on the y axis. Put small labels near each module to indicate if they're Front Left (0), Front Right (1), Back Left (2), or Back Right (3) . Using Phoenix Tuner, set the CAN id's & names of all Motors & CANCoders to match their physical location. Make sure their ids match the ones in your codebase's RobotMap.java . Getting the Swoffsets Power on the robot Deploy your current code to the robot if you haven't already Identify the front right and back right swerve modules Rotate both Bevels to face the robot's right Bevels are the spiky lookin gear things on the side of the wheel. They're on the opposite side of where you're going to put the swoffset block Insert the Swoffset blocks into those modules, pressing it in until it matches the image below. Then, press your straightedge into the flat part of the blocks to ensure that the modules are straight. Connect to the robot, then open Glass Navigate to the dropdown that shows the Absolute (Raw) Encoder values for your modules Front Left = 0, Front Right = 1, Back Left = 2, Back Right = 3 Copy the Absolute Encoder Raw value for that module and paste it into the offset constant in your code Once you've done both modules, repeat steps 3-8 with the front left and back left modules Take the blocks out before you begin driving the swerve Verifying your Swoffsets Redeploy code to the robot, now with the correct offsets Open AdvantageScope and navigate to the Swerve tab Drag over the Desired States and Actual States to Sources on the bottom of the window Open Driverstation, connect a controller, reset your pose to be relative to you, then begin driving If pressing up on the joystick makes the robot drive forwards, you've done swoffsets correctly! \ud83c\udf89 Verify that the Desired States mostly match the Actual States using the AdvantageScope UI. Revel in how cool they look. Then go get some fruit snacks because you've earned it \ud83d\ude0e Common Failures: Wheel(s) go in \"random\" directions. You may have mapped the wrong offsets to the wrong modules. Check that your front left module in code is mapped to the module on the robot's front left. Check that the offset you got from that module in glass was set to the same module in code. Repeat for all the modules. Another possible issue is a hardware issue with the CANCoder. Ensure that the magnet was glued when installing the module. An un-glued magnet will cause your module to slowly drift. Robot doesn't drive in the correct direction, but all of the wheels face the same way. Example: Moving up on the stick makes the robot go backwards You've likely done swoffsets incorrectly or mapped the modules incorrectly. Check that your front left module in code is mapped to the module on the robot's front left. Repeat for all of your modules. Then, redo your swoffsets and make sure you orient the wheels in the correct direction! - Robot starts driving correctly on boot, but wheel(s) excessively drift over time. Reboot the robot. If the robot begins driving correctly again on boot, this eliminates the CANCoder as the issue. If not, ensure that the magnet was glued when installing the module. Otherwise, there is likely something mechanically wrong with the module.

Reference the WPILib Robot coordinate system ; The robot's left is positive on the y axis. Put small labels near each module to indicate if they're Front Left (0), Front Right (1), Back Left (2), or Back Right (3) .

You may have mapped the wrong offsets to the wrong modules. Check that your front left module in code is mapped to the module on the robot's front left. Check that the offset you got from that module in glass was set to the same module in code. Repeat for all the modules. Another possible issue is a hardware issue with the CANCoder. Ensure that the magnet was glued when installing the module. An un-glued magnet will cause your module to slowly drift. Robot doesn't drive in the correct direction, but all of the wheels face the same way. Example: Moving up on the stick makes the robot go backwards You've likely done swoffsets incorrectly or mapped the modules incorrectly. Check that your front left module in code is mapped to the module on the robot's front left. Repeat for all of your modules. Then, redo your swoffsets and make sure you orient the wheels in the correct direction! - Robot starts driving correctly on boot, but wheel(s) excessively drift over time. Reboot the robot.
