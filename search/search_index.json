Every team member can contribute to keeping our wiki up-to-date! Quick Start There are three ways to update the wiki: 1. Web-based editing (easiest for small changes) 2. VSCode editing (best for larger changes or creating multiple pages) 3. GitHub Issues with Copilot (create an issue and let AI make the changes) Method 1: Web-Based Editing (GitHub.com) This is the fastest way to make small edits or fix typos. Editing an Existing Page Navigate to the wiki page you want to edit on supernurds.com/wiki Click the pencil icon (\u270f\ufe0f) in the top right corner of the page This will take you directly to the file on GitHub Click the pencil icon (Edit this file) on GitHub to enter edit mode Make your changes in the editor using Markdown syntax Scroll down to the \"Commit changes\" section Write a brief description of what you changed (e.g., \"Fix typo in setup instructions\") Choose one of the following: If you have write access: Select \"Commit directly to the main branch\" (for small fixes) If you don't have write access: Select \"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request\" Click \"Commit changes\" or \"Propose changes\" If you created a pull request, click \"Create pull request\" on the next page Your changes will be reviewed and merged by a team lead! Creating a New Page (Web) Go to the Wiki repository Navigate to the folder where you want to create the page (e.g., Software, Competition, etc.) Click \"Add file\" \u2192 \"Create new file\" Name your file with .md extension (e.g., New Guide.md ) Add your content using Markdown syntax Follow steps 5-9 from \"Editing an Existing Page\" above Method 2: VSCode Editing (Recommended for Multiple Changes) This method is better when you're creating multiple pages or making larger changes. First-Time Setup Install Required Software: Visual Studio Code GitHub Desktop Clone the Wiki Repository: Follow the guide in Downloading GitHub Projects Clone the Wiki repository from FRCTeam3255/Wiki Open in VSCode: Right-click the Wiki folder in GitHub Desktop Select \"Open in Visual Studio Code\" Making Changes in VSCode Open or Create a File: Navigate to the appropriate folder in the Explorer panel Open an existing .md file to edit Or create a new file: Right-click folder \u2192 \"New File\" \u2192 name it with .md extension Edit Your Content: Write your content using Markdown syntax VSCode will show a preview (press Ctrl+Shift+V on Windows or Cmd+Shift+V on Mac) Add Images (Optional): Take a screenshot and copy it to your clipboard In VSCode, paste the image ( Ctrl+V or Cmd+V ) where you want it The image will automatically be saved to the .images folder The correct markdown image link will be inserted Save Your Changes: Press Ctrl+S (Windows) or Cmd+S (Mac) to save Committing and Pushing Your Changes Once you're happy with your changes, you need to upload them to GitHub: Open GitHub Desktop: You should see your changed files listed Review Your Changes: Click on each file to see what changed Make sure everything looks correct Commit Your Changes: Write a brief summary in the \"Summary\" field (e.g., \"Updated software setup guide\") Optionally add more details in the \"Description\" field Click \"Commit to main\" (or your branch name) Push to GitHub: Click \"Push origin\" to upload your changes Create a Pull Request (if needed): If you're on a branch (not main), click \"Create Pull Request\" Fill out the description explaining your changes Click \"Create pull request\" Note: Once your changes are merged into the main branch, the wiki website will automatically update within a few minutes! Method 3: Using GitHub Issues with Copilot (Easiest - No Setup Required!) This is the simplest method - describe what you want changed, assign the issue to GitHub Copilot, and it will make the changes for you! Note: This requires GitHub Copilot to be enabled for the repository. Check with a team lead if you're unsure whether this is available. When to Use This Method You're not comfortable editing files directly You want to suggest changes without learning Git or Markdown You want to create new pages but prefer to describe what you need You need multiple changes across different files How to Create a Wiki Update Issue Go to the Issues Tab: Navigate to Wiki Issues Click \"New issue\" Describe Your Request: Title: Be specific (e.g., \"Add guide for pneumatics\" or \"Update battery selection page\") Description: Include as much detail as possible: What page(s) need to be changed What information needs to be added, updated, or removed Any specific formatting or structure you want Links to reference materials (if applicable) Screenshots or examples (if helpful) Assign to Copilot: On the right sidebar, under \"Assignees\", click and type copilot to find the Copilot bot Select the Copilot assignee from the list Add relevant labels if needed (e.g., documentation , enhancement ) Submit the Issue: Click \"Submit new issue\" Copilot will automatically start working on your request Review the Changes: Copilot will create a Pull Request with the changes You'll receive a notification when the PR is ready Review the changes and provide feedback if needed Once approved by a team lead, the changes will be merged and the wiki will update Example Issue Good Example: Title: Add guide for selecting pneumatic cylinders Description: Please create a new guide in the Mechanical folder that explains: - How to choose the right pneumatic cylinder for different applications - Common cylinder sizes used in FRC - Stroke length considerations - Force calculations - Where to find cylinders in inventory Include links to vendor websites and add images if possible. Another Example: Title: Update Software Conventions page with new naming rules Description: On the Software/Conventions.md page, please add a new section about: - Autonomous command naming: must start with \"Auto_\" - Subsystem class naming: must end with \"Subsystem\" - Constants file organization: one file per subsystem Also update the example code to reflect these changes. Tips for Good Issue Requests Be Specific: The more detail you provide, the better the results One Topic Per Issue: Create separate issues for different topics Include Examples: Show what you want with examples or links Provide Context: Explain why the change is needed Check Existing Pages: Link to existing pages that should be updated Markdown Basics Markdown is a simple way to format text. Here are the most common elements: Headings # Main Heading (H1) ## Subheading (H2) ### Sub-subheading (H3) Text Formatting **bold text** *italic text* ~~strikethrough~~ Lists - Bullet point 1 - Bullet point 2 - Sub-bullet 1. Numbered item 1 2. Numbered item 2 Links [Link text](https://example.com) [Link to another wiki page](../Software/Conventions.md) Images ![Image description](../.images/folder/image.png) Code Blocks ```python def hello(): print(\"Hello, World!\") ``` Tables | Column 1 | Column 2 | |----------|----------| | Data 1 | Data 2 | Admonitions (Special Boxes) !!! note \"Title\" This creates a highlighted note box. !!! warning This creates a warning box. !!! tip This creates a tip box. File Organization Place files in the appropriate folder based on topic: Software/ - Programming guides and code documentation Mechanical/ - Mechanical design and build guides Electrical/ - Wiring, electrical components, and diagrams Competition/ - Competition procedures and checklists Build Season/ - Build season specific documentation General/ - General team information and cross-functional guides GitHub/ - GitHub and version control guides etc. Use clear, descriptive file names (e.g., Setting Up Driverstation.md ) Store images in .images/ folder (this happens automatically with VSCode paste) Tips for Good Wiki Pages Be Clear and Concise: Write as if you're explaining to someone new Use Headings: Break content into sections with clear headings Add Screenshots: Images help clarify steps (especially for software guides) Include Context: Explain why something is done, not just how Keep it Updated: If you notice outdated information, fix it! Test Your Instructions: Try to follow your own guide to make sure it works Getting Help Markdown Help: Markdown Guide GitHub Help: See Downloading GitHub Projects Ask a Team Lead: Don't hesitate to ask questions! Review Process All changes go through a review process: You create changes and submit a Pull Request Team leads review your changes If approved, changes are merged The wiki website automatically updates This ensures all information is accurate and high-quality!","title":"How to Update the Wiki"},{"location":"General/How%20to%20Update%20the%20Wiki/#how-to-update-the-wiki","text":"This guide explains how to create and edit wiki pages.

Replace them with your actual motor name throughout the code examples. How Do You Normally Run a Motor? ( .set Percent Output (Power)) Most robot programmers start by running motors with a simple command: // Run motor at 50% forward power motorName.set(0.5); This sets the motor output as a percentage of full power (from -1.0 to 1.0). It's open-loop: the motor just runs at the power you ask, with no feedback or position control. Good for simple tasks, but not precise\u2014motors can overshoot, stall, or drift. What Is MotionMagic? MotionMagic is a special feature for controlling motors, made by CTRE for their Talon SRX and Talon FX motor controllers. It helps you move parts of your robot (like arms or elevators) smoothly and precisely to a target position, without needing to write complicated code. What Is PID Control? Before MotionMagic, people used something called \"PID control\" to make motors stop at the right spot. PID stands for: P roportional: How far you are from the target. I ntegral: How long you've been away from the target. D erivative: How quickly you're approaching the target. PID helps motors reach and hold a position, but tuning it can be tricky. MotionMagic uses PID behind the scenes, so you don\u2019t need to understand all the math\u2014it does the hard work for you! How Does MotionMagic Work? MotionMagic creates a plan for your motor to follow, called a \"motion profile.\" It decides how fast to go and how quickly to speed up or slow down, so your robot part moves smoothly to the target position. Output Control: .set vs .setControl Understanding how you command a motor is essential for using MotionMagic effectively. TalonFX motor controllers support two main ways to control output: Method What It Does Typical Use Case .set(value) Sets percent output (-1.0 to 1.0, or -100% to 100%) Simple open-loop power control .setControl(request) Uses advanced control modes (MotionMagic) Precise position or velocity Power Control - .set(value) - Percent Output This is the most basic way to run a motor. You give it a value between -1.0 and 1.0, and the motor runs at that percentage of full power. This does not use any feedback or closed-loop control. // Define the function in the Motion subsystem public void setMotorNamePower(double power) { motorName.set(power); } // Usage example of Percent Output double power = 0.5; // This would be stored in constants motionInstance.setMotorNamePower(power); // This would be called in the state Pros: Simple, direct, good for testing. Cons: No position or power control, can overshoot or stall. Position PID - .setControl(request) \u2014 MotionMagicExpo This method lets you use features like MotionMagic, PID, or velocity control. You create a control request object (such as MotionMagicExpoVoltage or MotionMagicVelocityVoltage ) that tells the motor controller exactly how to move, including target position or velocity, acceleration, and which PID slot to use. // Define the function in Motion Subsystem MotionMagicExpoVoltage motorNamePositionRequest = new MotionMagicExpoVoltage(0); // Create object at top of file and reuse public void setMotorNameAngle(Angle targetAngle) { motorName.setControl(motorNamePositionRequest.withPosition(targetAngle)); } // Usage example of angles as Degrees units Angle targetAngle = Degrees.of(65.15); // This would be stored in constants motionInstance.seMotorNameAngle(targetAngle); // This would be called in the state Pros: Precise, smooth, uses feedback sensors, supports profiles. Cons: Requires configuration and understanding of control modes. Position PID - Configuring Mechanism Settings Before using MotionMagicExpo, configure your mechanism's TalonFX with the correct position-control settings. This includes PID values, sensor-to-mechanism ratio, and gravity compensation type. PID values ( kP , kI , kD , kS , kG ) control how the motor responds to errors and gravity. // --- PID and Feedforward Constants --- // NOTE: We start by setting all to 0, we will tune these later // Feedforward MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.kS = 0; // Static gain (overcomes friction) MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.kG = 0; // Gravity feedforward (helps hold up against gravity) // PID MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.kP = 0; // Proportional gain (how hard to correct position error) GravityType tells the controller how to compensate for gravity (use Elevator_Static for vertical lifts, Arm_Cosine for rotating arms). DO DEMO // --- Gravity Compensation Type --- MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.GravityType = GravityTypeValue.Elevator_Static; // Use Elevator_Static for vertical lifts, Arm_Cosine for rotating arms SensorToMechanismRatio ensures setpoints and feedback are in real-world units (like inches or degrees). This is what we call \"Gear Ratio\". We just ask mechanical for this value. Each number represents a gear. // --- Sensor Conversion --- MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Feedback.SensorToMechanismRatio = ((12.0 / 60.0) * (26.0 / 52.0)); // MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Feedback.SensorToMechanismRatio = ((GEAR_1 / GEAR_2) * (GEAR_3 / GEAR_4)); // Converts motor rotations to mechanism units (e.g., inches of elevator travel) // --- Apply the config to motor like we already do --- motorName.getConfigurator().apply(constMotion.MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG); Velocity PID - .setControl(request) \u2014 MotionMagicVelocity Use this when you want to hit and maintain a target velocity. Set your targets and limits in WPILib RPM, then convert to the Talon's expected units under the hood. Keep everything in Slot0\u2014no extra slot juggling needed. // Define the function in Rotors Subsystem MotionMagicVelocityVoltage motorNameVelocityRequest = new MotionMagicVelocityVoltage(0); // Create once and reuse public void setMotorNameVelocity(AngularVelocity targetVelocity) { motorName.setControl(motorNameVelocityRequest.withVelocity(targetVelocity)); } // Usage example AngularVelocity shooterTargetRMP = RPM.of(4500); // This would be stored in constants rotorsInstance.setMotorNaVelocity(shooterTargetRpm); // This would be called in the state Pros: Precise, smooth, uses feedback sensors, supports profiles. Cons: Requires configuration and understanding of control modes. Velocity PID - Configure Mechanism Settings Before using MotionMagicVelocity, configure your mechanism's TalonFX with the correct velocity-control settings. This includes PID values, sensor-to-mechanism ratio, and any gravity compensation your mechanism needs. Keep everything in Slot0\u2014no slot switching\u2014and express targets/limits in WPILib Units.RPM , converting to the Talon's units. Slot0 gains \u2014 Velocity feedback ( kP , kI , kD ) plus feedforward ( kS , kV , kA ). Profile limits \u2014 MotionMagic acceleration and jerk, entered in RPM and converted to rotations/sec units. Gravity compensation \u2014 Optional; set if your velocity mechanism benefits from offsetting gravity.

If the robot is moving, someone should be recording. Let the media team know about important events, competitions, demonstrations, or any activities worth documenting. If it's not recorded, it didn't happen : Make sure to capture important moments as they happen. You can't edit what wasn't filmed. Video Management Workflow Importing and Organizing Create separate folders : Before transferring media, create separate folders in Finder for each batch of videos. This helps maintain organization from the start and makes it easier to track which footage has been reviewed. Import everything into Final Cut Pro : Instead of looking at videos in Finder, import everything directly into Final Cut Pro and review clips there. This provides better tools for evaluating footage. Reviewing and Tagging Clips Use Favorite and Reject : Review your imported clips and mark them: Press F to mark clips as Favorite Press DELETE to mark clips as Rejected Add keywords : Press Command + K to add keywords to videos. This allows you to search for specific clips later, making it much easier to find the footage you need. Assign video roles : Video roles in Final Cut Pro allow you to color code clips and take notes for organization. To assign a role, right-click on a clip and select \"Assign Audio/Video Roles\" from the menu. Use roles to mark clips that need changes, storyboarding elements, or specific video segments. This helps organize your workflow and communicate with team members through visual color coding. Storage Management Delete generated media : Only delete generated media (render files, optimized media, proxy media) once the project is exported. You can regenerate these files if needed, but they can take up significant storage while working on a project. Use external hard drives : Store your video files on an external hard drive and keep working from that drive. This prevents your computer's internal storage from filling up and allows you to move projects between systems if needed. DO NOT keep files on SD cards - always transfer to hard drives for editing and storage.

The front of the robot is typically the side that the scoring mechanism is on, but it can be any side. Having it be the scoring mechanism side makes it easy to remember. Whichever side you choose, you need to keep it consistent across both robots (comp & practice), the AdvantageScope models, and PathPlanner. You'll need to communicate which side is the front to the rest of the team. Steps Pick a side to be the front! Take Gaff tape and physically label the front of the robot so that it's visible from the underside Also label the robot's left & right. This saves lots of headaches later. If you're looking at the underside, this may not match your left and right, since they're relative to where the robot's left is when it's on the ground. This depends on how the robot is tipped over. Reference the WPILib Robot coordinate system ; The robot's left is positive on the y axis. Put small labels near each module to indicate if they're Front Left (0), Front Right (1), Back Left (2), or Back Right (3) . Using Phoenix Tuner, set the CAN id's & names of all Motors & CANCoders to match their physical location. Make sure their ids match the ones in your codebase's RobotMap.java . Getting the Swoffsets Power on the robot Deploy your current code to the robot if you haven't already Identify the front right and back right swerve modules Rotate both Bevels to face the robot's right Bevels are the spiky lookin gear things on the side of the wheel. They're on the opposite side of where you're going to put the swoffset block Insert the Swoffset blocks into those modules, pressing it in until it matches the image below. Then, press your straightedge into the flat part of the blocks to ensure that the modules are straight. Connect to the robot, then open Glass Navigate to the dropdown that shows the Absolute (Raw) Encoder values for your modules Front Left = 0, Front Right = 1, Back Left = 2, Back Right = 3 Copy the Absolute Encoder Raw value for that module and paste it into the offset constant in your code Once you've done both modules, repeat steps 3-8 with the front left and back left modules Take the blocks out before you begin driving the swerve Verifying your Swoffsets Redeploy code to the robot, now with the correct offsets Open AdvantageScope and navigate to the Swerve tab Drag over the Desired States and Actual States to Sources on the bottom of the window Open Driverstation, connect a controller, reset your pose to be relative to you, then begin driving If pressing up on the joystick makes the robot drive forwards, you've done swoffsets correctly! \ud83c\udf89 Verify that the Desired States mostly match the Actual States using the AdvantageScope UI. Revel in how cool they look. Then go get some fruit snacks because you've earned it \ud83d\ude0e Common Failures: Wheel(s) go in \"random\" directions. You may have mapped the wrong offsets to the wrong modules. Check that your front left module in code is mapped to the module on the robot's front left. Check that the offset you got from that module in glass was set to the same module in code. Repeat for all the modules. Another possible issue is a hardware issue with the CANCoder. Ensure that the magnet was glued when installing the module. An un-glued magnet will cause your module to slowly drift. Robot doesn't drive in the correct direction, but all of the wheels face the same way. Example: Moving up on the stick makes the robot go backwards You've likely done swoffsets incorrectly or mapped the modules incorrectly. Check that your front left module in code is mapped to the module on the robot's front left. Repeat for all of your modules. Then, redo your swoffsets and make sure you orient the wheels in the correct direction! - Robot starts driving correctly on boot, but wheel(s) excessively drift over time. Reboot the robot. If the robot begins driving correctly again on boot, this eliminates the CANCoder as the issue. If not, ensure that the magnet was glued when installing the module. Otherwise, there is likely something mechanically wrong with the module. This is typically an issue with the bearing or the belt.","title":"Swoffsets (Swerve Offsets)"},{"location":"Software/Swoffsets/#swoffsets-swerve-offsets","text":"","title":"Swoffsets (Swerve Offsets)"},{"location":"Software/Swoffsets/#resources-you-must-gather","text":"A straight-edge, slightly longer than the distance between modules (A 1 inch tube works fine for this) 2 Swoffset Bricks (3d printed, found in the Electrical Cabinet's \"Other Tools\" Drawer) A Laptop with the following Software installed: Glass Code for your robot FRC Driver Station AdvantageScope Phoenix Tuner A Controller Gaff Tape & A Sharpie","title":"Resources you must gather"},{"location":"Software/Swoffsets/#set-the-front-of-the-robot-if-not-already-done","text":"If this hasn't been done already, you need to determine where the front of the robot will be and name the modules accordingly.

You may have mapped the wrong offsets to the wrong modules. Check that your front left module in code is mapped to the module on the robot's front left. Check that the offset you got from that module in glass was set to the same module in code. Repeat for all the modules. Another possible issue is a hardware issue with the CANCoder. Ensure that the magnet was glued when installing the module. An un-glued magnet will cause your module to slowly drift. Robot doesn't drive in the correct direction, but all of the wheels face the same way. Example: Moving up on the stick makes the robot go backwards You've likely done swoffsets incorrectly or mapped the modules incorrectly. Check that your front left module in code is mapped to the module on the robot's front left. Repeat for all of your modules. Then, redo your swoffsets and make sure you orient the wheels in the correct direction! - Robot starts driving correctly on boot, but wheel(s) excessively drift over time. Reboot the robot. If the robot begins driving correctly again on boot, this eliminates the CANCoder as the issue. If not, ensure that the magnet was glued when installing the module. Otherwise, there is likely something mechanically wrong with the module. This is typically an issue with the bearing or the belt.","title":"Common Failures:"},{"location":"Software/TalonFX%20Blink%20Codes/","text":"TalonFX Blink Codes Falcon motors have LEDs that blink certain colors when something is happening or broken.

Ensure you are connected to the robot via its Wi-Fi. Open the ConstMotion.java or ConstRotors.java file to adjust the PID constants. Verify the gear ratio is correct (sensor to mechanism ratio in configuration). Verify the direction is correct before beginning tuning. Make sure soft limits are in Units Rotations (not raw encoder units). For Arm Mechanisms: Deploy should be a positive value (e.g., moving the arm outward/upward should increase position). Use the closed loop sign setting in the motor configuration to invert feedback polarity if needed (ensures feedback matches motor direction). Verify the forward limit is in the correct direction before tuning to prevent damage. Steps Set Gravity Type Configure the gravity compensation type in ConstMotion.java or ConstRotors.java based on your mechanism: Elevator_Static : For vertical lifts (elevators, lifts) Arm_Cosine : For rotating arms (pivoting mechanisms) MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.GravityType = GravityTypeValue.Elevator_Static; // or Arm_Cosine Use Phoenix Tuner for Initial Tuning Open Phoenix Tuner and connect to your robot. Navigate to the motor controller you're tuning. Use Phoenix Tuner's built-in PID tuning interface to adjust values in real-time: Start with all PID constants set to 0 . Tune kS (Static Gain) first - increase until the mechanism begins to move slightly. > Note: Keep this value as low as possible while ensuring the mechanism moves. Tune kG (Gravity Compensation) - increase until the mechanism holds position without drifting. > Note: If the gear ratio is high enough, kG might just be 0 as the mechanism can hold itself. Tune kP (Proportional Gain) - increase until the mechanism reaches setpoint without overshooting. Fine-tune the values in Phoenix Tuner until you achieve desired performance. Transfer Values to Constants File Once you have tuned the PID values in Phoenix Tuner: Copy the final tuned values from Phoenix Tuner. Update the corresponding constants in ConstMotion.java or ConstRotors.java : // Feedforward MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.kS = 0.25; // Value from Phoenix Tuner MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.kG = 0.30; // Value from Phoenix Tuner // PID MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.kP = 10.0; // Value from Phoenix Tuner Deploy the code with the new constants to verify the mechanism still performs as expected. For Flywheel Mechanisms Flywheels use velocity control rather than position control. The key constants to tune are kS and kV . Set kS Tune kS (Static Gain) the same way as other mechanisms \u2014 increase it until the flywheel just begins to spin. Note: Keep this value as low as possible while still overcoming static friction. Set kV Tune kV (Velocity Gain) so that, with only feedforward active (no PID), the flywheel reaches slightly below your lowest velocity setpoint. This ensures the closed-loop controller (kP) only needs to make small corrections upward, avoiding overshoot. Tip: Test at your lowest expected RPM setpoint and increase kV until the flywheel gets close but does not exceed it. Transfer Values to Constants File Once tuned, copy the values into your constants file: // Feedforward MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.kS = 0.25; // Value from Phoenix Tuner MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.kV = 0.12; // Value from Phoenix Tuner (reach slightly below lowest setpoint) // PID (fine-tune if needed) MOTOR_NAME_CONFIG.Slot0.kP = 1.0; // Value from Phoenix Tuner Deploy the code with the new constants to verify the flywheel performs as expected at all setpoints.
