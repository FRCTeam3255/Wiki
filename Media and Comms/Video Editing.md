# Video Editing

## Intro

For video editing we use a professional grade software known as Final Cut Pro (FCP)

## Media Team Best Practices

- **Communication is Key**: People need to tell media something interesting is happening. Let the media team know about important events, competitions, demonstrations, or any activities worth documenting.
- **If it's not recorded, it didn't happen**: Make sure to capture important moments as they happen. You can't edit what wasn't filmed.

## Video Management Workflow

### Importing and Organizing

- **Import everything into Final Cut Pro**: Instead of looking at videos in Finder, import everything directly into Final Cut Pro and review clips there. This provides better tools for evaluating footage.
- **Create separate folders**: Make separate folders for each batch of videos when transferring from camera to computer. This helps maintain organization and makes it easier to track which footage has been reviewed.

### Reviewing and Tagging Clips

- **Use Favorite and Reject**: Review your imported clips and mark them:
  - Press `F` to mark clips as **Favorite**
  - Press `DELETE` to mark clips as **Rejected**
- **Add keywords**: Press `Command + K` to add keywords to videos. This allows you to search for specific clips later, making it much easier to find the footage you need.
- **Assign video roles**: Mark clips for specific purposes such as clips that need changes, storyboarding elements, or specific video segments. This helps organize your workflow and communicate with team members.

## Storage Management

- **Delete generated media**: Regularly delete generated media (render files, optimized media, proxy media) to conserve disk space. You can regenerate these files if needed, but they can take up significant storage.
- **Use external drives**: Store your video files on an external drive and keep working from that drive. This prevents your computer's internal storage from filling up and allows you to move projects between systems if needed.
