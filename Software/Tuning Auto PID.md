# Tuning Auto PID

create an auto that travals 1 meeter in any direction

tape 1 meeter on the field on the corner

Line up robot with tape and make sure driving direction is correct

unalive limelight

set pid constants to p=1 and everythong alse to 0

get fruitsnacks for the programmer

run the auto and increce p until the robot lines up with the end of the tape

Now, extend the tape by another meeter and hope that it still works

Now, edit your path to add a 180 degree in place turn.

Now, you did with the driving pid, (tuning p) and tune the p in the auto rotation section insted until the robot sucsesfully completes the rotation in auto.

Add B if it is slightly overshooting

you are now done, comit your changes.
